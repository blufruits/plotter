# x and y plotter

This repository exists purely to aid my learning of Python. As a result of this there are many comments that are probably not useful to others. The pyplot module from the matplotlib library is requried.

What the script does:

The script will ask the user if any data pairs would like to be input (x and y). If yes, the data will be input and saved to a 'data.csv' file in the same directory as the .py file (the x_y_plotter directory). This step can be repeated to the user's liking. When the user has finished inputtng the data, a scatter plot will be displayed. Since the data is stored in the 'data.csv' file, the scatter plot can be amended over time.

Usage:

This can be used to gain insight to the relationship between two variables. Here is an example. The user may be a delivery driver who is payed per delivery, with the amount payed being some function of the total distance travelled. This person may wonder how their pay varies with distance. By inputting many past distance+pay pairs into the .csv file, the scatter plot displayed will provide insight.
